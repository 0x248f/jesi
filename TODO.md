# TODO

* Replace vm with puppeteer for modules to allow for greater flexibility in the permissions subsystem and to provide a standard browser environment to modules
* Find and implement a tool to document the code
* Add module-writing documentation
* Add dependency resolution to modules (list dependencies in modules.json, the bot should rewrite the package.json and run npm install accordingly)
* Print clearer error messages when modules fail
* Handle ISUPPORT
* HTTP API (as a module)
* Web-based IRC client interface
* Allow users to configure and start IRC bots from the available modules in the server, from the interface
