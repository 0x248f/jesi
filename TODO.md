# TODO

* Find and implement a tool to document the code
* Add module-writing documentation
* Better handling of module definitions (move to modules/modules.json, implement as a list in config.json)
* Add dependency resolution to modules (list dependencies in modules.json, the bot should rewrite the package.json and run npm install accordingly)
* SASL support (as a module)
* IRCv3 support (as a core module)
* Add user privilege checks to the permission-based filter
* HTTP API (as a module)
* Web-based IRC client interface
* Allow users to configure and start IRC bots from the available modules in the server, from the interface
